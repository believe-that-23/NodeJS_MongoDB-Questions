## Title: Enhancing Transaction Handling in MongoDB Application

### Introduction + Scenario:
You are working on a MongoDB application that manages expenses. The application already includes basic functionality to create, retrieve, update, and delete expenses. Your task is to empower developers by enabling them to implement transactional features within the provided codebase. Specifically, developers should focus on enhancing the provided routes to handle transactions effectively. This feature will contribute to the application's robustness, ensuring data consistency and integrity during complex operations.

### Objectives:
1. Allow developers to enhance specific routes in the `controller` and `repository` files to implement transactions.
2. Enable the execution of multiple operations as a single transaction for improved data integrity.
3. Ensure that the application gracefully handles transaction errors and maintains data consistency.

**Expected Output:**
Developers should modify specific functions within the controller and repository files to implement transactional features for particular routes. Upon implementation, the application should execute the operations within a single transaction, ensuring atomicity. In case of any transaction errors, the application should roll back changes to maintain data consistency.

### Requirements:
- Developers should use the existing `ExpenseModel`, `ExpenseRepository`, and `ExpenseController` classes for this implementation.
- Modify the `controller` and `repository` files to incorporate the `session.withTransaction()` method for transaction handling.
- Clear code comments should guide developers on where and how to implement transactions within the codebase.

### Resources:
- MongoDB documentation on transactions: [link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/)

### Notes/Hints:
- Developers should focus on the provided routes that involve complex operations and modify those routes to handle transactions effectively.
- Use the `session.withTransaction()` method to encapsulate multiple operations within a single transaction.

### Note: 
The provided code is representative of the problem context. The solution should guide developers to enhance specific functions and files for transaction handling as described.

### Additional Notes:
- The provided code includes the existing structure of the application, including the `ExpenseModel`, `ExpenseRepository`, and `ExpenseController` classes.
- Developers should concentrate on updating the mentioned functions in the `controller` and `repository` files to implement transactional features within the specified routes.
