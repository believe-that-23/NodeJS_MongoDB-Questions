## Title: 
Grunt Task Challenge - Text Replacement

### Introduction:
In this coding challenge, you will be tasked with creating a Grunt task that replaces specific text patterns in an HTML file. Grunt is a popular JavaScript task runner that automates various development tasks. 

### Objectives:

- Define a task named 'replace' within the Grunt configuration.

- Configure the 'replace' task to operate on the 'src/index.html' file.

- Set the 'patterns' option to replace all the occurrences of the text 'foo' with 'bar'. Make sure to use the desired regex expression.

- Save the modified HTML file to the 'build' directory while maintaining the original filename.

### Output:

When the grunt command is executed on the terminal, all occurrences of "foo" in the index.html file must be replaced with "bar."

### Notes:
- There should be one index.html file present in the src directory. 

- The folder structure should remain unchanged.
