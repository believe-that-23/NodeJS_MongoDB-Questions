### Title: 
Book Management API

## Introduction + Scenario:
You are tasked with building a RESTful API for managing books using Mongoose and Express. The API should allow users to create new books and retrieve book details by their IDs. This API will serve as the backbone for a book management system.

## Objectives:

1. Create a model, using the "bookSchema".
2. Implement a function to create a new book with the attributes of title, author, genre, copies, and available copies.
3. Develop an endpoint to retrieve book details by providing a book ID.

## Expected Output:

Output should look like: https://files.codingninjas.in/fina-31065.mp4

## Notes/Hints:

1. Ensure proper error messages and status codes are used for error responses.
2. Make sure to handle cases where a book with a given ID does not exist.
3. No need to change the pre-written code.
