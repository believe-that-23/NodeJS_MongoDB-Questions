### Title:
Book Inventory Management System

## Introduction + Scenario:
In this coding challenge, you are tasked with building a Book Inventory Management System using Mongoose and Express. We have already implemented the create and retrieve functionalities, and now we will proceed to implement other critical functions. This system will allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete book records, making it essential for efficient book management.

## Objectives:

1. Create a route to update the availability of a book based on its ID and quantity.
2. Implement a function to delete a book record by its ID.
3. Add a route to list books by a specific genre.

## Expected Output:

Output should look like: https://files.codingninjas.in/screencast-from-09-13-2023-04-21-29-pm-31079.webm 

- Updating book availability should return the updated book details in JSON format.
- Deleting a book should result in a JSON response confirming the deletion.
- Listing books by genre should return a JSON array of matching books.
## Requirements:

- Use Mongoose for database operations.
- Utilize Express.js for routing.

## Resources:

Mongoose documentation can assist with database interactions.
Refer to Express.js documentation for route handling.

## Notes/Hints:

1. Ensure proper error handling for cases like book not found or server errors.
2. The provided code is a starting point for your solution, so focus on completing the missing functions.
